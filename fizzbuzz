# My coder friends challenged me to write a fizz buzz program. Glad my studying is paying off hahaha.
# Fizz Buzz Challenge: Write a program that prints 1 to 100, but for:
# Multiples of 3, print "Fizz"
# Multiples of 5, print "Buzz"
# Multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"

for i in range(1, 101):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
        i += 1
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print('Fizz')
        i += 1
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print('Buzz')
        i += 1
    else:
        print(i)
        i += 1
