 When I say:       That means:
 Pico              One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
 Fermi             One digit is correct and in the right position.
 Bagels            No digit is correct.
 
 For example, if the secret number was 248 and your guess was 843, the clues would be Fermi Pico.''')
