# python_mini_games
Here are projects I created for the Python Mini Projects course at Zenva Academy and Python Mini Projects from No Starch Press. I learned how to define, design, code, execute, and evaluate Python programs.
I was introduced to many programming concepts, including Python Turtle, input commands, randomness, and loops. Although the projects are simple, the experience 
was incredibly valuable. My favorite takeaways were learning hown to design, flow chart, and pseudo code python programs.

Thank you for viewing my code and reading this doc!
